In stage 2, the system provides a simulation of a traffic intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights. The system is capable of simulating vehicles arriving at the intersection, waiting at the traffic lights, and crossing the intersection when the lights turn green. The simulation is designed to be thread-safe and uses synchronized threads to ensure that vehicles do not interfere with each other while crossing the intersection.
